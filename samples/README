This directory contains examples of state diagrams with input to and output
from drawstate.pl.  For those who can't view SVG, PNG is also provided.

This file explains the meaning of the diagrams.

Coins:
coinop.input coinop.svg coinop.png
Suppose you have a coin operated vending machine which accepts 5, 10, and
25 cent coins.  If it needs 25 cents for each purchase, accepting states
are 25 and 30 (this diagram is simplified, while still showing common
features).  The edges are numbered with coin denomination.  The
nodes are labeled with the accumlated total of coins deposited to date.
This example is the one that t/01state.t uses to test the generator.

Tennis:

This represents the state machine for scoring tennis.  The edges are labeled S
for server and R for receiver of serve.  The nodes are labeled with things
the chair umpire might say at Wimbledon, except that the chair would replace
Server and Receiver with names.
