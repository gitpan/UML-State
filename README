UML/State version 0.01
======================

UML::State helps drawstate.pl produce simple UML state diagrams.
The diagrams do not attempt to comply to any particular version of
UML.  They merely allow you to make diagrams which help you see
states and transitions.

The diagrams are rigid in structure with nodes located in a grid.
If you don't like this approach, you should probably use GraphViz.
