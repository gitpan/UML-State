      Added drawstatexml.pl which reads an xml format for the state machine.
      This has the usual xml advantages and disadvantages.  In addition,
      the user needs even less skill to use the xml format.  In it states
      have names.  They are connected by name instead of col,row as in
      the text format handled by drawstate.pl.
